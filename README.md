# PS5_Amazon_checker
This program will email you when the PS5 becomes available for purchase on the amazon store. 

The program will refresh the page for the PS5 or any other out of stock item on amazon every 30 seconds. When the buy now button becomes available to click an email
will be sent to a target of your choice, the list of targets can be added to very esily allowing you to send a stock alert email to a group of your frends. The 
message can be customised to have a link to the amamzon page however, this will load a page that wont be signed into your account as amazon automatically log 
you out if loading a page through selenium (haven't learnt how to get passed that one yet).
